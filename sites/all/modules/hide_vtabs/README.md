# Hide Vertical Tabs

Hide VTabs is a module to control visibility over the vertical tabs on a per
content type basis.

You have three options for setting the visibility:
- Hide vertical tabs
  This will hide all the options that are selectable by the user that are under
  vertical tabs group (additional_settings);

- Show vertical tabs
  This is the Default option for vertical tabs, it will show all the tabs
  normally;

- Show revision only
  This option will remove the revision from the vertical tabs group
  (additional_settings), and then hide the other items.

## Development

Hide VTabs is jointly developed by [CI&T](http://www.ciandt.com/) and [Dave Hall Consulting](http://davehall.com.au).
